(*

In this part you must provide sufficient functionnality to demonstrate your almighty power in OCaml.
• Your program must draw a wibbily wobbly timey wimey creature on the main screen
• You must also draw basic meters : health, hygiene, energy, happyness (you’re free to draw it as you like but it must remain consistent with the concept.)
• You must also draw basic button/area to allow the end user to select an action to perform : EAT, THUNDER, BATH, KILL
